## Instructions

### instralling vagrant and virtual box
- download and install vagrant and virtual box

- open your console in the `vagrant` folder and type `vagrant up` ... the virtual machine is being initialized for the first time
- type `vagrant ssh` for a secure terminal connection to the virtual machine

### creating the database
- `cd` into the `torunament` subfolder
- run the `psql` command
- type `\i tournament.sql` to run the database script
